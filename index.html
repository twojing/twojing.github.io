          <h1>The World as We Knew It</h1>
          <p><img src="/images/kates-kitchen-map.jpg"></p>
          <p>In the beginning, we thought this was the world that we would live, move, and breath in. U.S.A. We had driven through the country twice at this point. The first time Nathan and my brother helped me drive from my little apartment in Lancaster, CA (if you don't know where that is, it's in the Mojave desert) to Dayton, OH. At that time, Nathan and I were not even engaged. We discussed the idea but no promises were made or accepted. My brother was sent, at the request of my parents, as a chaperone.</p>
          <p>The second time we drove cross country, it was as husband and wife. Nathan and I had been married for 7 years by this point. He got an opportunity to work on a small team with his company. The world was full of promise, yet full of uncertainty. Fast forward to today. As I type this, our small San Francisco apartment is practically empty again and we find ourselves embarking on a larger adventure. The destination - Berlin, Germany. This is our story.</p>

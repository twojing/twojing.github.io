         <p>In a couple weeks my husband, Nathan, and I are driving cross country together for the third time. We have lived in San Francisco for a little over a year now and we are driving east to visit family and friends before we move. As I type this, our small apartment is practically empty and we find ourselves embarking on another adventure. The destination is Berlin, Germany. This is our story.</p>

          <p> I took this picture really quickly one day. Nathan was still recovering from his bike accident and didn't want to get out of the Zipcar we rented. I don't blame him. It was cold and foggy. It was the first time we had both seen the Golden Gate Bridge and the Pacific Ocean since we moved to SF.</p>

          <p>The view of the lighthouse was breathtaking. Nathan's aunt and uncle were on vacation visiting some vineyards in Sonoma. They wanted to explore a bit of Northern California with us. My boss, who has visited Northern California several times, recommended we go to Point Reyes. There are a series of stairs leading up to the lighthouse you see here. Unfortunately they were closed off for the day.</p>
